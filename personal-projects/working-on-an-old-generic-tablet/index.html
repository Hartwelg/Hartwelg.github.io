<p>The Mach Speed Trio Stealth G2 8&#8243; Tablet. Released September of 2013 by Mach Speed Technologies, LLC. I had one and it worked for about a year. Seven years later, I want to use it for&#8230; something. Some ideas on what to use it for included: a display for my Raspberry Pi, a test system for Android apps (should I decide to develop Android apps), a small home server, a webcam (using one of the built-in cameras), a desktop dashboard for displaying time, local weather, and some daily news, or simply another device to have on my desk at home.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/9fe6a999-e225-4826-9832-35a006717717_1.32d7ebe09a02c2aead10370f794324ff.jpeg" alt="https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/9fe6a999-e225-4826-9832-35a006717717_1.32d7ebe09a02c2aead10370f794324ff.jpeg" width="376" height="376"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Trio Stealth G2 Tablet.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>My initial goal was to just get it to boot into the operating system (or any operating system, for that matter). I just wanted to know it worked before i did anything else with it. To that end, I decided to find out as much as I could about the tablet, so I began to search the internet for any and all information I could find on it. The specs for this device weren&#8217;t too difficult to find, even though neither the company nor their website exists anymore. I found two places with a list of specs for the device:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/trio-stealth-g2/#p=trio-stealth-g2-8-tablet-android-4-1-jelly-bean-8-gb-8/">https://www.cnet.com/products/trio-stealth-g2/#p=trio-stealth-g2-8-tablet-android-4-1-jelly-bean-8-gb-8/</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.alphachooser.com/tablet_computers--trio_stealth_g2_8-inch--tablet_computer-specs-and-profile">https://www.alphachooser.com/tablet_computers&#8211;trio_stealth_g2_8-inch&#8211;tablet_computer-specs-and-profile</a></p>



<p>I found these by just searching the name of the tablet and seeing what showed up. The top result when searching &#8220;Trio Stealth g2 specs&#8221; was the CNET page, which also had listings for the other devices in the stealth g2 line. The second link above was found by searching &#8220;Trio stealth 8 specs.&#8221; The rest of the search results were ads and listings on several websites that were trying to sell this thing. Overall, the reviews for this device were abysmal, averaging around 2/5 stars just about everywhere I looked.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>According to the information I could find, these are the tablet&#8217;s specifications: </p>



<ul>
<li>8-inch LCD display (1024&#215;768 resolution, 10-point capacitive multi-touch)</li>
<li>3 megapixel camera (front and rear)</li>
<li>3.5mm headset jack</li>
<li>Amlogic AML8726-MXS Processor (more on this later)</li>
<li>8GB system memory</li>
<li>1GB RAM</li>
<li>MicroSD slot capable of handling up to 32gb cards</li>
<li>Lithium-Ion battery with 8-hours of battery life, 4-hour charge time</li>
<li>USB 2.0 capability (through micro-usb port)</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<p>After one year of owning it, this tablet simply refused to work anymore. Occasionally, the operating system (Android 4.1 Jelly Bean) would become corrupted, requiring a factory reset of the tablet in order to make it work again. This eventually stopped working, leaving the tablet useless to anyone. I was left with what is shown below: the boot screen and then another screen telling the user what kind of CPU is housed within the tablet. The boot process would not progress past this point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-417" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1024x768.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-300x225.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x576.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x1152.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-2048x1536.png 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2: Initial boot screen.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-415" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x768.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x225.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x576.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x1152.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2048x1536.png 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Second boot screen.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first thing I did in an effort to make this tablet work again was to disassemble it to see if anything was amiss inside the case. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but I recognized that the battery was over seven years old at this point, so I decided to replace it. Shown below is the only information I found on the battery.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-768x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-421" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-768x1024.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-225x300.png 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-1152x1536.png 1152w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 4: 3.7v, 3800mAh Li-Ion battery.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a matching battery anywhere at the time, so I found one with matching voltage and a lower mAh to replace it with. I didn&#8217;t plan to use this tablet anywhere but at home, so it would most likely be plugged in all the time anyway.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-423" width="320" height="283" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5.png 668w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-300x265.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-5-666x591.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 5: 3.7v, 1200mAh Lithium Polymer battery.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-7-768x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-425" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-7-768x1024.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-7-225x300.png 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-7-1152x1536.png 1152w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-7-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 6: New battery installed and fits nicely where the old one was.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now, in the image above, we can see the tablet&#8217;s motherboard. Everything inside this tablet is stuck to the back of the screen (as I&#8217;m sure is a common practice).The new battery is soldered to the motherboard in the bottom-left corner (from our point of view). To the right of the battery contact points is the ribbon cable connector for the screen&#8217;s digitizer. Further to the right of this is the ribbon connector for the LCD screen itself. To the far right is where the Wi-Fi module is connected to the motherboard, and above this is the connection for the front- and rear-facing cameras. further above the camera connection is the module for the power, volume+ and volume- buttons. From here, we can move left along the top edge of the motherboard to find the headphone jack, a separate microphone jack, the usb port, power cable plug, the reset button, and finally the MicroSD card slot on the far left. In the center of the motherboard we see the processor: the AMlogic AML8726-MXS SoC (System On Chip).</p>



<p>I was curious about this processor, so I began searching for information on it. That search led me to an article from design-reuse.com, published November 12, 2010 about the release of this SoC.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.design-reuse.com/news/24916/amlogic-arm-cortex-a9.html">https://www.design-reuse.com/news/24916/amlogic-arm-cortex-a9.html</a></p>



<p>The article talks about the capabilities of the processor (like 1080p video for H.264, VC-1, WMV, MPEG1/2/4 and 1080P HDMI output, ability to run Android 2.2, Linux, OpenGL ES 2.0, and browser support for HTML5, Adobe Flash 10.1 and Adobe Air.), but the part that I was interested in was the actual components of the SoC. These included the ARM Cortex A9 Processor and and ARM Mali-400 GPU. The Cortex A9 uses the ARMv7-A architecture. I found this information as part of a search for mobile operating systems that were compatible with this architecture.</p>



<p>Next, I tried to find information about the LCD screen, as I wanted to see if I could use it by itself as a display for my Raspberry Pi. Hidden under the digitizer ribbon cable in the image above is a few lines of information that I will type here:</p>



<p>JB08001HD2FPC_A2<br>HSD080PXNI-A00-0220<br>JB_ZZY20130118</p>



<p>I entered the first two lines into a search engine individually and found just about nothing relevant, aside from two links to aliexpress.com, both leading to the same page. The rest of the search results were in a different language.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32872515371.html">https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32872515371.html</a></p>



<p>From what I could tell, the screen shown in the above link is a very similar screen, but not quite the one that is in my tablet. The ribbon cable is a different shape, but is still a 40-pin cable. That is about all I could find about this specific LCD screen at this point. Searching &#8220;Trio Stealth g2 8 inch screen&#8221; gave a few hits on Ebay where the screen could be purchased from independent sellers.</p>



<p>Next, I decided to search for information on some of the other components of this tablet. I looked for the digitizer online (ribbon cable in the bottom-left corner of the above picture) and found several hits for different websites where this part was listed for sale. For those curious, searching &#8220;YTG-P80002-F1&#8221; will return the digitizer for this tablet pretty quickly. You can get the same (or better) results by searching &#8220;Trio Stealth g2 8 inch digitizer.&#8221; I found some replacement motherboards that were for a different model within the Stealth G2 line of tablets (none for the specific tablet I have), one front and rear camera module, and one listing for a new case. The rest of the results I found were from people trying to sell their own Stealth G2 tablets.</p>



<p>The parts of this tablet that I specifically cared about were the CPU and the LCD screen. Having been unable to find any useful information about the LCD screen I had, I moved on to my original goal of just getting it to boot into the operating system. I was able to find a user manual for this tablet at <a href="https://www.manualslib.com/manual/631576/Trio-Stealth-G2.html?page=3#manual">https://www.manualslib.com/manual/631576/Trio-Stealth-G2.html?page=3#manual</a>, which was very helpful with general information about the tablet. Within the manual, I found the correct button combination to put the system into recovery mode (Power and Volume+ simultaneously, then release power button when system turns on). From here, I tried doing a full system wipe and factory reset using the &#8220;wipe media partition,&#8221; &#8220;wipe cache partition,&#8221; and the &#8220;wipe data/factory reset&#8221; options. This didn&#8217;t help anything, as I was still stuck with the tablet only showing the second boot screen (Figure 3). This led me to believe that the system&#8217;s firmware was corrupted, or the tablet was otherwise unable to boot into its own operating system. At this point, I put it back into recovery mode and looked through my other options. The rest of the options in the recovery screen were &#8220;apply update from ADB,&#8221; &#8220;apply update from EXT,&#8221; and &#8220;apply update from cache.&#8221; I first looked through the cache option and found nothing (since I wiped it), and then I looked through the EXT option. This showed an empty directory (because there was no SD card in the tablet. I later learned that the &#8216;EXT&#8217; option was referring to the EXT file system), so I selected the ADB option and was met with this screen:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-446" width="605" height="453" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-1024x768.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-300x225.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-768x576.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-1536x1152.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-2048x1536.png 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 7: ADB sideload screen.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the time, I did not know what &#8220;ADB&#8221; meant, so when I was met with a message on the tablet saying &#8220;Now send the package you want to apply to the device with &#8220;adb sideload &lt;filename&gt;&#8221;&#8230;&#8221; I had no clue what to do or what it was talking about. This led me to researching this mysterious &#8220;ADB&#8221; option. The first clue I had was the command syntax that the tablet gave me (&#8220;adb sideload &lt;filename&gt;&#8221;). This told me that ADB was a program. Since this was a tablet that used the Android operating system, I could then assume the &#8220;A&#8221; in &#8220;ADB&#8221; stood for &#8220;Android.&#8221; What a genius I was.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>I searched &#8220;ADB&#8221; in my search engine and the first result was the one needed: <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb</a>. Through this link, I learned that &#8220;ADB&#8221; meant &#8220;Android Debug Bridge&#8221; and it was used for flashing ROMs, updates, and otherwise moving files to and from a mobile device with a pc. This is possible provided the device in question has developer options and USB debugging enabled (if the user is trying to unlock the device or flash a custom recovery to it). I was in a situation where that wasn&#8217;t the case, however. Since the tablet couldn&#8217;t boot into the OS, I was unable to enable developer options and USB debugging. My next step was to see if I could enable USB debugging though recovery mode on the tablet. This led me to several different places, which I will list below:</p>

</ul>



<p>The first link was my first stop. It gives a flat &#8220;no&#8221; as the answer, and then goes on to talk about using fastboot instead. The Trio Stealth G2 does not have fastboot, so this option was unavailable to me.</p>



<p>The second and third links call for USB OTG as a method of interacting with a device that has a broken or otherwise unusable screen. This was not my case, so I didn&#8217;t have any use for those options. The second link goes on to detail how to use the &#8220;Broken Android Data Extraction&#8221; tool for connecting to a mobile device and extracting the data on it. I couldn&#8217;t go this route for a couple of reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>There was no data on the tablet that I needed/wanted to access.</li>
<li>I was searching for a way to access the tablet in the first place.</li>
</ul>



<p>The third link also called for the &#8220;Android Unlock Tool&#8221; to bypass a lock screen, but that also wasn&#8217;t my case, so I skipped that part of the article. The final part of that article gives the same answer as the first link: enabling USB debugging using ADB just can&#8217;t be done. However,  the article also mentions booting the device into ClockworkMod Recovery. I followed up on that later on.</p>



<p>The fourth link in the above list mentions downloading the stock ROM for the device in question and then flashing it to the device. At the time of this writing, the website for the company that made the tablet I was working with did not exist anymore (more on that later), and the manufacturer&#8217;s website did not exist either, so the stock ROM for the tablet was unattainable as far as I could tell. </p>



<p>Now for the fifth and sixth links. The fifth link specifically deals with rooting the Trio Stealth G2 line of tablets (screen size doesn&#8217;t matter, they all have the same specs) and the sixth link is about rooting generic tablets. I eventually determined that both of these links weren&#8217;t of any use to me at the time because they both called for connecting to a tablet with USB debugging enabled.</p>



<p>So, all of my searching led me back to square one. I still am unable to get the tablet to boot into the operating system at this point. My next couple of stops were on <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia.com</a> to learn about Android 4. I read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Jelly_Bean">here</a> (Wiki article about Android Jelly Bean) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">here</a> (Android version history). I learned about Android development history and some features that were added in successive Android versions. </p>



<p>At this point, I decided to try to use ADB to move a file to the tablet. I created a .txt file called &#8220;test.txt&#8221; within the &#8220;platform-tools&#8221; directory and tried flashing it to the tablet with &#8220;adb sideload test.txt.&#8221; ADB was able to send my file to the tablet successfully, and the tablet responded with this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-451" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-1024x768.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-300x225.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-768x576.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-1536x1152.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-2048x1536.png 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-9-440x330.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Figure 8: ADB sideload screen after trying to sideload test.txt</figcaption></figure>



<p>This tells me I can interact with the tablet through ADB, provided I have the right kind of file.</p>



<p>After this, I went to <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean">https://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean</a> to learn about Jelly Bean straight from the source: android.com. My goal here was to find out if I could download a version of Jelly Bean so that I could flash it to my tablet and try to boot it into that. I was led to the Android source repository at <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/">https://android.googlesource.com/</a> from <a href="https://source.android.com/">https://source.android.com/</a>. I came back to this later, as I was a little overwhelmed at the time with what I was looking at. I would later use <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/build-custom-android-rom-720453/">this</a> article about building custom Android ROMs to try and build my own version of an Android 4.1 ROM to flash to my tablet. We&#8217;ll come back to this.</p>



<p>Back to to ClockworkMod lead I mentioned earlier. After I was initially exposed to ClockworkMod at <a href="https://medium.com/@harryjhonson779/best-ways-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-locked-android-phone-4a5308544683">https://medium.com/@harryjhonson779/best-ways-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-locked-android-phone-4a5308544683</a>, I went on to read about custom recovery for Android devices at <a href="https://techsphinx.com/smartphones/best-custom-recovery-for-android-devices-2020/">https://techsphinx.com/smartphones/best-custom-recovery-for-android-devices-2020/</a>. Here, I learned about TWRP and several forks of it and what they are used for. The article I read was more of a cursory glance at custom recovery for Android devices, but it helped me to learn a bit more about the world of customizing Android devices. TWRP and ClockworkMod Recovery looked to be the most commonly used options for custom recoveries. My thinking was that I could flash a custom recovery to my tablet so that I could have access to some more system options within the recovery menu, but I ran into the same problem as I have been the whole time up to this point: flashing custom recovery requires access to the tablet&#8217;s operating system and USB debugging to be enabled. The tools developed by ClockworkMod all seemed to be hosted on Google Play, so I could not use them for my purposes.</p>



<p>From here, I went to <a href="https://www.clockworkmod.com/">https://www.clockworkmod.com/</a> to learn about ClockworkMod itself. I learned that ClockworkMod is a company that specializes in customizing Android devices through several means, such as flashing custom ROMs, using Android devices from a pc, backup solutions, and even universal Windows drivers for ADB. I decided to try downloading Vysor, ClockworkMod&#8217;s Android remote access tool, to see if I could make any headway with it. Surprise surprise, it requires USB debugging to be enabled. My thinking was that it was possible that the tablet was actually booting into the operating system, but the screen was not showing it, so Vysor could have been a way to see what was on the screen after the second boot screen. However, Vysor requires USB debugging to be enabled for that feature. An interesting thing I found was that Vysor also detected the tablet when it was in recovery mode (after selecting the ADB option), but trying to connect to it returned an error stating &#8220;did not receive adb socket client okay.&#8221; Searching this error didn&#8217;t seem to return any results that mentioned my specific error, so I moved on to trying a different method.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Now back to flashing my own custom ROM to the tablet. I thought it would be cool to be able to put a Linux distribution on the tablet, just to see if I could do it. The first thing I did was to try to find out if the ARM Cortex A9 had support from a Linux distribution. </p>
